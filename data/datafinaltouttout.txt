6	Save the earth.
6	Reduce your carbon footprint by using environmentally friendly transportation methods, reducing waste and energy use around the home or workplace, and actively participating in conservation initiatives such as beach cleanups and tree planting events.
6	Keep our planet healthy by going green with renewable energy sources like wind and solar power instead of non-renewable coal plants that release harmful emissions causing climate change when burned; composting food scraps rather than sending them off to polluting landfills where methane gas (CH4) is produced during decomposition which causes global warming! Help protect precious ecosystem biodiversity.
6	Keep the air fresh; switch to cleaner sources like hydropower or geothermal for electricity instead of using old fossil fuels Recycle more – upcycle if possible! This lowers waste sent into oceans where plastic harms marine life - it also reduces your carbon footprint at home.
6	Do your part by reducing, Reuse whenever possible, then only throw away when absolutely necessary
6	Recycle more; reuse bags, water bottles, and containers instead of throwing them out after one use It not only protects the soil but also ensures our natural resources are conserved for future generations.
6	switch to reusable straws and refillable pens Recycle more, using correctly labeled bins to decrease pollution from rubbish in landfill sites.
6	Make environmentalism fun by recycling old items into cute decor pieces for your home or garden like turning a plastic bottle into a self-watering plant pot and repurposing an old tire as a fun planter.
6	Plant trees around your neighborhood to boost local biodiversity and combat climate change while saving money on heating and cooling costs thanks to the shade provided by their leaves during extreme weather events.
6	Try composting! Compost helps enrich soil quality and grows better fruits and vegetables, which increases general health; keep food waste out of landfills as much as possible through compost creation in your backyard using fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, tea bags, etc.
6	Recycle more plastic than usual this month! Plastics are the highest contributor to pollution worldwide—the simplest action we can take is reducing daily use of plastic Try carrying reusable containers for lunch and dinners or switching your cleaning supplies from regular (wasteful) spray bottles to refillable dispensers.

6	Over the past decade, an estimated three trillion single-use plastic bags have been used annually around the world, resulting in their being found in every ocean of the world because the majority are not recycled properly.
6	Over the past ten years, approximately three trillion disposable plastic bags have been consumed worldwide each year, leading to the prevalence of their discovery inside all the Earth's oceans since most items of this sort end up as litter instead of recycling appropriately.
6	The annual waste generated by non-biodegradable plastic totals over eight million tons, a reality which has led scientists, ecologist groups such as Greenpeace, WWF as well the United Nations to petition respective governments around the globe for change; in an effort hoping not one additional bit of the polluting substance will touch our planet ever again.
6	8 Million+ tons annually are thrown as toxic global garbage as opposed to zero if we each took recyclables home to properly sort; this to save earth as all human inhabitance hangs dangerously close to being past saving due to ignorant disposal habits resulting in our current reality.
6	That number marks how much water can fit within just one plastic bottle- the very vessel that has become so conveniently tossed with such little second thought contributing greatly to overall land-based and oceanic trash pollution levels which currently hover at over 14 billion pounds per year across this very blue planet Earth, causing immeasurable damage furthering an already grim outlook without changes to waste production patterns and sustainable materials
