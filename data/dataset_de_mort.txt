6	Save the earth.
6	Reduce your carbon footprint by using environmentally friendly transportation methods, reducing waste and energy use around the home or workplace, and actively participating in conservation initiatives such as beach cleanups and tree planting events.
6	Keep our planet healthy by going green with renewable energy sources like wind and solar power instead of non-renewable coal plants that release harmful emissions causing climate change when burned; composting food scraps rather than sending them off to polluting landfills where methane gas (CH4) is produced during decomposition which causes global warming! Help protect precious ecosystem biodiversity.
6	Keep the air fresh; switch to cleaner sources like hydropower or geothermal for electricity instead of using old fossil fuels Recycle more – upcycle if possible! This lowers waste sent into oceans where plastic harms marine life - it also reduces your carbon footprint at home.
6	Do your part by reducing, Reuse whenever possible, then only throw away when absolutely necessary
6	Recycle more; reuse bags, water bottles, and containers instead of throwing them out after one use It not only protects the soil but also ensures our natural resources are conserved for future generations.
6	switch to reusable straws and refillable pens Recycle more, using correctly labeled bins to decrease pollution from rubbish in landfill sites.
6	Make environmentalism fun by recycling old items into cute decor pieces for your home or garden like turning a plastic bottle into a self-watering plant pot and repurposing an old tire as a fun planter.
6	Plant trees around your neighborhood to boost local biodiversity and combat climate change while saving money on heating and cooling costs thanks to the shade provided by their leaves during extreme weather events.
6	Try composting! Compost helps enrich soil quality and grows better fruits and vegetables, which increases general health; keep food waste out of landfills as much as possible through compost creation in your backyard using fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, tea bags, etc.

6	"The Arctic tundra is home to less than 5% of the world's population, yet it contains nearly 30% of the Earth's carbon stored in its permafrost.
6	"Planting billions of trees could cut global warming in half.
6	Restoring damaged ecosystems can help mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon dioxide.
6	planting trees helps reduce air pollution, protect biodiversity, and combat climate change
6	Recycling can significantly decrease pollution by reducing waste sent to landfills where it decomposes and contributes to global warming.
6	64 billion pounds - this is the amount that global recycling saves yearly from being sent to landfills, which in turn decreases greenhouse gas emissions produced annually by 195 million metric tons.
6	64 billion pounds.
6	The average adult produces about 4 pounds of trash per day, which translates to an astounding 64 billion pounds of waste produced annually worldwide.

6	Conserving water is essential to protect marine ecosystems - just one cup of water is enough to sustain an entire day's worth of energy for our planet!
6	Eleven billion tons of plastic waste have been discarded on Earth since mass production began in the 20th century, endangering human health through contamination of oceans throughout the world; this also severely threatens thousands species from extinction over the next decade or so if action isn't taken soon.
6	Over the past decade, an estimated three trillion single-use plastic bags have been used annually around the world, resulting in their being found in every ocean of the world because the majority are not recycled properly.
6	Over the past ten years, approximately three trillion disposable plastic bags have been consumed worldwide each year, leading to the prevalence of their discovery inside all the Earth's oceans since most items of this sort end up as litter instead of recycling appropriately.
6	The annual waste generated by non-biodegradable plastic totals over eight million tons, a reality which has led scientists, ecologist groups such as Greenpeace, WWF as well the United Nations to petition respective governments around the globe for change; in an effort hoping not one additional bit of the polluting substance will touch our planet ever again.
6	8 Million+ tons annually are thrown as toxic global garbage as opposed to zero if we each took recyclables home to properly sort; this to save earth as all human inhabitance hangs dangerously close to being past saving due to ignorant disposal habits resulting in our current reality.
6	That number marks how much water can fit within just one plastic bottle- the very vessel that has become so conveniently tossed with such little second thought contributing greatly to overall land-based and oceanic trash pollution levels which currently hover at over 14 billion pounds per year across this very blue planet Earth, causing immeasurable damage furthering an already grim outlook without changes to waste production patterns and sustainable materials

6	Humanity has extinguished one percent of all plant and animal life-approximately eight million species-since 1970 according to scientists. They anticipate even more extinctions if habitat degradation continues at its current pace as we enter the 6th Mass Extinction Event in Earth's history.
6	One billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water because natural environments have become increasingly polluted due to human activities, compromising their health as a direct result of this issue that needs to be rectified soon!
